"""
BasicTree Class

Intent is to use this to represent any tree-like thing.

We think of a tree is being composed of subtrees, joined together
at the root.  A tree has-a list of children.

If the list of children is empty, we say the tree is empty.

An empty tree t is constructed by
    t = BasicTree()

If t_0, t_1, ..., t_n are Trees, then
    t = BasicTree([t_0, t_1, ..., t_n])
constructs a tree with the given subtrees as children.
Children are ordered, left to right, in same order as the list.

Question: During construction, Can t_i and t_j be the same tree?

Maybe yes, maybe no, depending on how the tree is going to be used. If
it is immutable, then this structure sharing would be ok. If it can be
changed, then the children being passed must be "different" or
"independent", for some meaning of this.

Pre-condition:
    The children must be "independent".
