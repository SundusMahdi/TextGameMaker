    ValueTree class

    A ValueTree is an attributed BasicTree.  Each node of the tree has an
    associated value.

    ValueTree(v) - constructs a new instance, with value v and no
    children. It is a leaf.

    If each of t0, t1, ..., tn is-a ValueTree, then
        t = ValueTree(v, [t0, t1, ..., tn] )
    constructs a new tree with value v, and children t0, t1, ..., tn
    It is an internal node.

        A valshape (value shape) is a representation of the the tree that
        describes both the shape and value attributes of the tree.

        Base case:  If t = ValueTree(v), then
            t.tree_to_valshape() is the tuple (v, [])

        Inductive construction: If c = [t_0, ..., t_n] are ValueTree, and
        t = ValueTree(v, c), then
            t.tree_to_valshape() is the tuple (v, [ vs_0, ..., vs_n ])
            where vs_i is the valshape of child t_i.

        >>> t.tree_to_valshape()
        (1, [(2, [(3, []), (4, [])]), (5, [])])

        Note that if the values in the tree have string representations,
        then value shapes can be used to save and load value trees on
        string-based storage.
